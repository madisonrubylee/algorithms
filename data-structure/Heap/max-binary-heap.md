# Heap (data-structure)

In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized tree-based 
data structure that satisfies the heap property described
below.

## max binary heap 
* Each parent has a most two child nodes 
* The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
* In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the childeren, but there are no guarantees between 
silbling nodes.
* A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the childeren of each node are as full as they can be and 
left children are filled out first
