# Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree has everything filled in that means all the leaf nodes are full and there's no node that only has one child. A node either has zero children or two children. And also the bottom layer of the tree is completely filled. 

A full binary tree, which simply says that a node has either a zero or two children but never one child.
