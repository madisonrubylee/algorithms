# Greedy Algorithms

- In CS, a greedy algorithm is an algorithm that finds a solution to problems in the shortest time possible. It picks the path that seems optimal at the moment without regard for the overall optimization of the solution that would be formed.
- Many Greedy algorithms were developed to solve graph problems. A graph is a structure made up of edges and vertices.
