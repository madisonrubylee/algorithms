# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming alogrithm. It calculates the maximum sum subarray ending at a particular position by using the maximum sum subarray ending at the previous position.

The simple idea of Kadane's algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array. And keep track of maximum sum contignous segment among all positive segments.
